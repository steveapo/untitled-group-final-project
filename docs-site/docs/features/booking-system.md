# Booking System

The booking system provides an intuitive, interactive experience for reserving hotel rooms with visual date selection and real-time availability checking.

## Booking Lifecycle

```
CONFIRMED → CHECKED_IN → CHECKED_OUT
   (booked)   (in hotel)    (departed)
```

### Booking States

| State | Meaning | Who Created | Can Cancel? |
|-------|---------|-------------|------------|
| **CONFIRMED** | Room is reserved, ready for check-in | User or Reception | Yes |
| **CHECKED_IN** | Guest has arrived and checked in | Reception | No |
| **CHECKED_OUT** | Guest has departed | Reception | No |

## User Booking Flow

Users can book rooms through the **Search and book a room** option in the User menu.

### Step 1: Number of Guests

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║      BOOK A ROOM                     ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝

Number of guests (1-9, Esc to go back): █
```

Specify how many people will stay. This filters room availability by capacity.

### Step 2: Interactive Occupancy Calendar

The system displays a **real-time visual calendar** showing room availability:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║    MARCH 2026 - OCCUPANCY CALENDAR   ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝

       Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun

```

**Cell Meanings:**
- **Green solid (██)** = Room available for booking

### Step 3: Booking Confirmation

The system shows a summary of your booking and asks for confirmation:

╚══════════════════════════════════════╝

## Check-In / Check-Out

### Check-In

Convert CONFIRMED → CHECKED_IN:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║     CHECK IN GUEST                   ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝

  Enter guest username (Esc to go back): user1

```

## Availability Calculation

The system determines room availability by checking:

1. **Room status** — Not in MAINTENANCE
2. **Booking conflicts** — No existing booking that overlaps with requested dates
3. **Guest capacity** — Room capacity ≥ number of guests

**Date overlap rules:**
- `BOOKED: 2026-03-15 to 2026-03-17`
- Request 2026-03-14 to 2026-03-15 = **Available** (check-out/check-in on same date allowed)
- Request 2026-03-15 to 2026-03-18 = **NOT available** (overlaps existing booking)
- Request 2026-03-17 to 2026-03-19 = **Available** (no overlap)

## Pricing

### Rate Calculation
```
Total Cost = (Check-out Date - Check-in Date) × Room Nightly Rate
Example: 3 nights × $89.99/night = $269.97
```

### Price Display
Prices are shown:
- Per night (in room listings)
- Total cost (in booking confirmation)
- All in USD format with 2 decimal places

## Booking Cancellation

### User Cancellation
Users can cancel CONFIRMED bookings:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║   CANCEL A BOOKING                   ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝

  Your active bookings:
  
  1. Room R401 | 15-03-2026 → 17-03-2026 | $179.98
  2. Room R102 | 20-03-2026 → 22-03-2026 | $179.98
  
  Select booking to cancel: █
  
  ✔ Booking cancelled!
```

**Cannot cancel:** CHECKED_IN or CHECKED_OUT bookings (must go through reception)

### Reception Cancellation
Reception can cancel any booking:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║   CANCEL A BOOKING                   ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝

  Enter guest username (Esc to go back): user1
  
  1. Room R401 | 15-03-2026 → 17-03-2026 | CONFIRMED
  
  Select booking to cancel: █
